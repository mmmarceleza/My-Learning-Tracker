The GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data.

`POST`

The POST method is used to submit an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.

`PUT`

The PUT method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.

`DELETE`

The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.
